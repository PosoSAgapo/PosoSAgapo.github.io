I am a PhD student at the University of Tokyo, Department of Computer Science, [Miyao Lab](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index).

My research interests are in the field of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 
The main focus of my research is LLM analysis and its interpretability, especially regarding its memorization and generalization. Previously, I also had some experience in Semantic Parsing and Cognitive Science X NLP.
