I am a PhD stucent at The Universityof Tokyo, Department of Computer Science, [Miyao Lab](https://mynlp.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index).  

I also work as a intern in the [CyberAgent AI Lab](https://cyberagent.ai/ailab/) at NLP Group and also affliated with the Evaluation Group at LLM-jp group where I work as a Research Assistant and mainly evaluate how pre-training, fine-tuning affects the model and how to systematically evaluate the ability of model rather than performance.  
  
My research interests are in the field of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Mainly in the analysis and evaluation of large language models and understand their abilities through various tools. Previously, I have also worked in the Cognition-Inspired NLP method, Temporal Commonsense Reasoning and Representation Learning, etc.

During my study at SCIR, I took one year worked as a remote intern at Miyao Lab.
