\textbf{Problems:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=em,itemsep=0.05em]
\item Single-setting MIA experiments â†’ biased evaluation, creating an inconsistent performance across previous literature.
\item We need a statistical-level analysis
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Setup:} 5,000+ experiments to profile one MIA method

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=em,itemsep=0.05em]
\item \textbf{Methods}: 11 MIA methods
\item \textbf{Models}: Pythia series, OLMo2 series
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,itemsep=0.1em]
\item \textbf{Splitting Method Effect}: Relative Split > Complete Split > Truncate Split
\item \textbf{Model Size}: Performance scales with model size, indicating an internal change occurred in LLM that benefits the MIA when increasing model size.
\item \textbf{Domain Differences}: Wikipedia, FreeLaw perform best, e.g, free text domain with high token diversity; code/math domains worse, e.g, domains with lower token diversity
\item \textbf{Method Comparison}: Min-k\% ++ and ReCaLL relatively better, but most methods don't significantly outperform baselines

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,itemsep=0.1em]
\item Thresholds vary significantly across domains, and outliers exist, showing the instability of a good threshold.
\item Thresholds change with model sizes, meaning that a threshold decided in a small or large model cannot be applied to another model size
\item The lack of universal thresholds is an overlooked challenge for MIA methods in real-world applications, severely affecting practicality.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,itemsep=0.1em]
\item \textbf{Internal Correlation}: Whether being differentiable or not is also reflected in the embedding level.
\item \textbf{Model Size}: Large models show emergent behavior, significantly improved embedding separability when reaching deep layers in larger models.
\item \textbf{Final Layer Limitation}: Current MIA methods' reliance on final layer embeddings is suboptimal, as the final layer has a low embedding separability.

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.65\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,itemsep=0.1em]
\item We conducted a statistical revisiting of the MIA method to address the performance inconsistency.
\item It is challenging to determine a stable threshold for differentiating between members and non-members.
\item Different MIA methods work in different situations, indicating that there are no "winner-takes-all" situations in MIA.
\item The differentiability is reflected in LLM's inner structure, including both the embedding separability and the decoding dynamics.
\end{itemize}


% \textbf{Future Directions:}
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,itemsep=0.1em]
% \item Develop adaptive MIA method combination strategies
% \item Explore integration of multi-layer embedding information
% \item Address threshold stability issues
% \item Extend evaluation to larger-scale models
